# SmartReaderBot ðŸ“š

The **SmartReaderBot** is a Telegram bot designed to help users interact with information from their documents using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It is a tool for Telegram users who need to extract information from text-based resources such as PDFs, Word files, or plain text.

---

## Key Features âœ¨

- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval-based and generative AI to provide precise and contextually relevant answers to user queries.
- **File Support**: Converts text-based files (e.g., PDFs, Word documents) into Markdown format using **[MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)**, making them accessible for processing.
- **FAISS Database**: Stores embeddings of text chunks for fast and accurate similarity search.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily switch between different LLMs, embedding and reranking models via the `config.py` file.
- **Text Chunking**: Uses **Langchain** to split documents into manageable chunks for processing and retrieval.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Allows users to interact with the bot in their preferred language (currently supports English, German and Russian).
- **Allowlist System**: Only allows access to the bot for users authorized by admin.

## How It Works ðŸ› 

1. **File Upload**: Users upload text-based files (e.g., PDFs, Word documents) to the bot.
2. **File Conversion**: The bot converts the file into Markdown format using **[MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)**.
3. **Text Processing**: The text is cleaned and split into chunks using **Langchain**.
4. **Embedding Storage**: Embeddings are generated for each chunk and stored in a **FAISS database**.
5. **Query Handling**: When a user asks a question, the bot retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the database and sends them to the LLM for generating a response.
6. **Response Delivery**: The bot sends the LLM-generated response back to the user.

**Note**: The bot does not support images or other non-textual content.
